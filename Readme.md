#   Simon Game Challenge

The Simon Game is a memory challenge game where the player needs to repeat a sequence of colors and sounds generated by the game. Each round, the game adds a new color to the sequence, and the player must click the buttons in the same order to progress. The game ends when the player makes a mistake by clicking the wrong color.

## Features

1. Color Sequence Generation:
The game generates a random sequence of colors that the player needs to remember and repeat.

2. User Interaction:
Players interact with the game by clicking on colored buttons. The game tracks the sequence of clicks made by the player.

3. Sound Effects:
Each color has an associated sound that plays when the button is clicked, helping players associate visual and auditory cues.

4. Levels:
The game starts at level 1, and the difficulty increases as the sequence of colors grows longer with each level.

5. Game Over and Restart:
If the player clicks the wrong button at any point, the game ends with a "Game Over" message. Players can press any key to restart the game.

6. Animations:
The buttons animate when pressed, providing a visual feedback for user actions, which enhances the gameâ€™s interactivity.
